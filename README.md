# Linkedin-leads

Starter implementation for an AI-powered lead generation and outreach platform.

## Current development stage
We have started the product build from the PRD roadmap with **Step 1 (compliance-first lead ingestion)**:
- Python service scaffold for ingestion logic.
- Lead ingestion service for official APIs / vetted providers only.
- In-memory lead storage and listing method.
- Initial automated tests.

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the full step-by-step plan.

## Run tests
```bash
pytest
