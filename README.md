# Linkedin-leads

Starter implementation for an AI-powered lead generation and outreach platform.

## Current development stage
We have started the product build from the PRD roadmap with:
- **Step 1**: compliance-first ingestion (official APIs / vetted providers only).
- **Step 2**: ICP-configurable rule-based scoring with transparent score breakdown.
- **Step 3**: controlled draft generation scaffold (tone/template/CTA + personalization evidence metadata).

See `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for the full step-by-step plan.

## Run tests
```bash
pytest
```
